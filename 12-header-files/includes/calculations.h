// This file is known as a header file; it basically contains a list of the different functions contained in calculations.cpp, but without the detailed implementation/definitions. This is considered better practice because it allows you to keep the implementation hidden (which is not always necessary, e.g. in open source projects, but is sometimes needed)

#include <iostream>

int add(int, int);

int suc(int, int);

void outputMessage(std::string message);
