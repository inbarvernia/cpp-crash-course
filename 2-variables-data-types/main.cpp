#include <iostream>

int main() {

    //To declare a variable, we must declare the variable type followed by the variable name and assigning a value
    int x = 10;
    // And it can easily be assigned a new value like so:
    x = 90;
    x = 20;
    // But `x = "Hello";` wouldn't work because C++ is statically typed, meaning a variable can't have a different data type assigned as its value (in this case, x is an int so cannot be assigned to a string value)
